# PDF to Text API

PDF to Text extracts the text layer of a PDF, uploaded or fetched from a URL, and returns it as plain text with the page, word and character counts. Paid plans add the text of each page separately and the document metadata, such as title, author and creation date.

## Configuration

Before using the PDF to Text API client, you have to setup your account and obtain your API Key.
You can get it by signing up at [https://apiverve.com](https://apiverve.com?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=readme)

---

## Quick Start

[Get started with the Quick Start Guide](https://docs.apiverve.com/quickstart?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=readme)

The PDF to Text API documentation is found here: [https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/pdftotext](https://docs.apiverve.com/ref/pdftotext?utm_source=npm&utm_medium=referral&utm_content=readme).
You can find parameters, example responses, and status codes documented here.

### Setup

```javascript
const pdftotextAPI = require('@apiverve/pdftotext');
const api = new pdftotextAPI({
    api_key: '[YOUR_API_KEY]'
});
```

---

## Usage

### File Upload

This API requires a file upload. Use `executeWithFile()` to upload files:

```javascript
// Upload a file (path, Buffer, or ReadStream)
api.executeWithFile('/path/to/file.pdf', options, callback);
```

**Accepted file types:** .pdf
**Maximum file size:** 10 MB

---

### Perform Request

Using the API is simple. All you have to do is make a request. The API will return a response with the data you requested.

```javascript
// This API requires a file upload
// You can pass a file path, Buffer, or ReadStream
var filePath = '/path/to/pdf.pdf';

api.executeWithFile(filePath, function (error, data) {
    if (error) {
        return console.error(error);
    } else {
        console.log(data);
    }
});
```

---

### Using Promises

You can also use promises to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
// This API requires a file upload
// You can pass a file path, Buffer, or ReadStream
var filePath = '/path/to/pdf.pdf';

api.executeWithFile(filePath)
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
    });
```

---

### Using Async/Await

You can also use async/await to make requests. The API returns a promise that you can use to handle the response.

```javascript
async function makeRequest() {
    // This API requires a file upload
// You can pass a file path, Buffer, or ReadStream
var filePath = '/path/to/pdf.pdf';

    try {
        const data = await api.executeWithFile(filePath);
        console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error(error);
    }
}
```
